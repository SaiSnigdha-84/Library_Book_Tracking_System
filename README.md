# Library_Book_Tracking_System
On keeping the working of manual system as basis of my project I developed an automated
of manual system named as “LIBRARY BOOK TRACKING SYSTEM” .It retrives large
information within short period of time and it reduces the manual paperwork through it and gives
proper information of books.
This system will help the customers to find products as per their query in less time.Managing
a library manually is labour intensive and an immense amount of paperwork is involved.
